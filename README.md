Additional materials to disseration titled: In silico modeling using in vitro High Throughput Screening data for in vivo animal toxicity prediction within REACH

This repository contains the additonal materials related to the investigations conducted in the disseration titled: In silico modeling using in vitro High Throughput Screening data for in vivo animal toxicity prediction within REACH. These materials are made available to the scientific community and the regulators to utilize.

The disseration will be published on the online library of the Technical Library of Munich shortly and a link will be included here.

The materials are divided into 2 sections:

**Supplementary Materials**; which are also available as part of the dissertation itself in its printed version. these are:

Supplementary materials 1: List of in vivo endpoints from ToxCast / ToxrefDB, their respective total number of hits and whether it was selected for modeling. (XLS and PDF formats)
Supplementary materials 2: List of in vitro assay endpoints, their respective total number of hits and whether it was selected for modeling. (XLSX and PDF formats)
Supplementary materials 3: List of ToxCast Phase I chemicals excluded from modeling due to failed descriptors calculation. (PDF format) 
Supplementary materials 4: Statistical parameters for the models with best balanced-accuracy for each of the 144 in vitro assay endpoints from the ToxCast database.
Supplementary materials 5: Statistical parameters for the models with best balanced-accuracy for each of the 61 in vivo toxicological endpoints from the Toxicity reference database.

**Additional materials**; these cover detailed statistical analysis of thousands of QSAR mdoels and were not printed as part of the the dissertation itself but are available here for download:
Additional materials 1: Statistical parameters for 8296 models constructed using 136 algorithm/descriptors combinations for each of the 61 in vivo toxicological endpoints from the Toxicity reference database (in XLS and PDF formats)
Additional materials 2: Statistical parameters for 12672 models constructed using 88 algorithm/in silico descriptors combinations for each of the 144 in vitro assay endpoints from the ToxCast database. (in XLS format)
Additional materials 3: Statistical parameters for 8296 models constructed using consensus between 120 models from 10 descriptor packages. (in CSV format)
Additional materials 4: Predictions of ToxCast LEL submitted by the author (team: AMAZIZ) in the EPA ToxCast LEL challenge and awarded the fifth place. (in CSV format)
Additional materials 5: Predictions of the perturbation of 12 molecular pathway endpoints for all EINECS compounds. (in CSV format)
Additional materials 6: PTS score for EINECS compounds. (in CSV format)
